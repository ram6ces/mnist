# Number Recognition with NMIST Model

This project is a web application that allows users to draw numbers and test the NMIST model for number recognition. The NMIST model is a machine learning model that has been trained on a dataset of handwritten digits and can recognize digits with high accuracy.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:
```
pip install torch
```

```
pip install torchvision
```

Once you have these dependencies installed, you can run the web application by running the following command in your terminal:

```
python3 scrypt.py
```


## Usage

To use the web application, simply draw a number in the canvas provided and click the "Recognize" button. The NMIST model will then attempt to recognize the number you have drawn and display the result on the screen.
